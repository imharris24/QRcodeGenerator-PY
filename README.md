## About The Project

A QR code is a type of matrix barcode invented in 1994 by the Japanese company Denso Wave. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that can contain information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. QR codes use four standardized encoding modes to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.

The quick response system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes. Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.

A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background, including some fiducial markers, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera, and processed using Reed–Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.

This python script generates a QR code of entered URL of data.

### Execution

Below are the instructions that will help you run `main.py`.

1. Install qrcode using pip
```sh
pip install qrcode
```
2. Run command prompt.
3. Write the following intructions on _cmd_,
```sh
$ # Assign execution permissions
$ chmod +x main.py
$ # Run the script by using its filename
$ ./main.py
```


## Roadmap
